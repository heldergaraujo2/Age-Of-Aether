# Age Of AetheR — Unreal 5.8.1 Execution Continuity

> Canonical checklist for the local Unreal Engine execution phase. Updated after every command/result cycle.

## Rules
1. Never mark a runtime step PASS without Helder's actual result/log/screenshot.
2. One command at a time when diagnosis depends on the previous result.
3. After every result, analyze it, update this file, then issue the next command.
4. Prefer the lowest-bureaucracy workflow: Data Assets + reusable components + a few Widget Blueprints.
5. Never create fake .uasset, .umap, FBX, animation, VFX or audio files in Git.
6. If a step fails, repair it before continuing.
7. State-changing gameplay remains server-authoritative.
8. Visual assets are presentation and never gameplay authority.

## Current global state
- Repository/source roadmap: Phases 19–56 complete at source level.
- Unreal 5.8.1 local runtime: NOT YET VERIFIED.
- Current local execution phase: U0 — Environment & Project Health.
- Current step: U0.1 — Confirm project path; Unreal 5.8.x installation path was NOT found by the tested roots.
- Last command/result: U0.1 PowerShell check completed.
- Blockers: exact Unreal installation path/version still unknown.

# U0 — Environment & Project Health

## U0.1 — Confirm project + Unreal installation
Status: PARTIAL / BLOCKED ON ENGINE PATH

Result:
- Project found: D:\Projeto Age of Aether\Age-Of-Aether-main\AgeOfAether.uproject
- The command found no directory matching UE_5.8 under the four tested roots:
  C:\Program Files\Epic Games
  D:\Program Files\Epic Games
  D:\Epic Games
  C:\Epic Games
- This does NOT prove Unreal is absent. Helder explicitly reports Unreal is installed; it may be installed through a different path or launcher-managed location.

Analysis:
- Project location is confirmed.
- Before version verification/build, we must locate the actual Unreal executable/installation.
- U0.1 is not PASS because the required engine path evidence is incomplete.

## U0.2 — Verify exact engine version

# Command/result journal

## Entry 001 — U0.1
Status: PARTIAL / BLOCKED ON ENGINE PATH
Command: PowerShell project + UE_5.8 root scan.
Result:
- Project: D:\Projeto Age of Aether\Age-Of-Aether-main\AgeOfAether.uproject
- No UE_5.8 directory found in the four tested roots.
Analysis: Project is confirmed, but the Unreal installation path remains unresolved. The negative scan is not sufficient to conclude Unreal is not installed.
Next: Locate the actual Unreal Editor executable/installation with one PowerShell command.
