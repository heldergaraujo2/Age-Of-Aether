# Age Of AetheR — Unreal 5.8.1 Execution Continuity

> Canonical checklist for the local Unreal Engine execution phase. Updated after every command/result cycle.

## Rules
1. Never mark a runtime step PASS without Helder's actual result/log/screenshot.
2. One command at a time when diagnosis depends on the previous result.
3. After every result, analyze it, update this file, then issue the next command.
4. Prefer the lowest-bureaucracy workflow: Data Assets + reusable components + a few Widget Blueprints.
5. Never create fake .uasset, .umap, FBX, animation, VFX or audio files in Git.
6. If a step fails, repair it before continuing.
7. State-changing gameplay remains server-authoritative.
8. Visual assets are presentation and never gameplay authority.

## Current global state
- Repository/source roadmap: Phases 19–56 complete at source level.
- Unreal 5.8.1 local runtime: NOT YET VERIFIED.
- Current local execution phase: U0 — Environment & Project Health.
- Current step: U0.1 — Locate/confirm Unreal installation; Epic registry installation root is now confirmed.
- Last command/result: Registry lookup returned C:\Program Files\Epic Games\.
- Blockers: exact installed engine subdirectory/version still needs verification.

# U0 — Environment & Project Health

## U0.1 — Confirm project + Unreal installation
Status: PARTIAL — INSTALL ROOT CONFIRMED

Result:
- Project found: D:\Projeto Age of Aether\Age-Of-Aether-main\AgeOfAether.uproject
- Windows Epic Games Unreal Engine registry key exists.
- INSTALLDIR = C:\Program Files\Epic Games\
- Earlier UE_5.8 directory scan did not find an engine directory directly under the tested roots.
- Get-Command UnrealEditor.exe returned no path because UnrealEditor.exe is not on PowerShell PATH.

Analysis:
- This is useful evidence that Unreal Engine is installed through Epic's registered installation root.
- We should now inspect only C:\Program Files\Epic Games\, avoiding a full C:/D: recursive scan.
- U0.1 remains PARTIAL until the exact engine directory/version is confirmed.

# Command/result journal

## Entry 001 — U0.1
Status: PARTIAL / BLOCKED ON ENGINE PATH
Command: PowerShell project + UE_5.8 root scan.
Result:
- Project: D:\Projeto Age of Aether\Age-Of-Aether-main\AgeOfAether.uproject
- No UE_5.8 directory found in the four tested roots.
Analysis: Project is confirmed, but the Unreal installation path remained unresolved.

## Entry 002 — U0.1
Status: PARTIAL / BLOCKED ON ENGINE PATH
Command: PowerShell PATH lookup for UnrealEditor.exe.
Result: No output.
Analysis: UnrealEditor.exe is not exposed through PATH. This does not prove Unreal is absent.

## Entry 003 — U0.1
Status: PARTIAL — INSTALL ROOT CONFIRMED
Command: PowerShell registry lookup for the Epic Games Unreal Engine installation root.
Result:
- INSTALLDIR : C:\Program Files\Epic Games\
Analysis: The Windows registry confirms the Epic Games Unreal Engine installation root. The exact UE version/subdirectory is still pending.
Next: Inspect only the confirmed Epic Games root for UE_5.8 directories.
